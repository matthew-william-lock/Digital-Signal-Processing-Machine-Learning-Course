# Terminology and Notation

## Features
 Individual attributes that can be measured or recorded about an event or entity. Categorical or numerical data.
- These are shown in a vector form. For example if looking at the states for the COVID-19 statistics

## Labels, Hyperparameters
- Not to be confused with learned model parameters
- Determined by processes other than learning algorithm
- May impact **how** model learns

In supervised learning, ground truth is denoted at:
<br><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y=\begin{bmatrix} y_1\\y_2\\\vdots\\y_k\end{bmatrix}" /> <br>

And the predicted output is denoted as:
<br><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y=\begin{bmatrix}\hat{y_1}\\\hat{y_2}\\\vdots\\\hat{y_k}\end{bmatrix}" /> <br>

## Training, Validation and Testing Sets

Training set:
- Collection of examples used to train
- Learn from these to perform parameter updates

Validation set:
- Separate from training set
- Does not update parameters
- Validate current models to check generalization
- Perhaps change hyperparamters

Test set:
- Separate from training and Validation Sets
- Used once training/validation is complete
