## 1.Supervised Learning
The learning algorithm is provided with labeled input data. This can be costly for large data sets as we generally need
a human expert to label the data. 

## 2.Unsupervised Learning
The learning algorithm is supplied with unlabelled data. This is like trying to study a past test without having any solutions.
Using this method we can still learn the structure of the data, which data point are similar (clustering), or reduce the 
dimensionality of the data (by finding which dimensions are most important to the data).

## 3.Reinforcement Learning
A learning agent can learn and interact with an environment. We are able to :
- Determine state of agent and environment
- Interact with agent and environment
- Use a reward to promote certain behavior of the agent (reward determined by how well task is completed)
