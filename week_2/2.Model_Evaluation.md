# Model Evaluation

## Generalization
- How well does our model perform on unseen data?
- Can we diagnose specific problems?
    - Overfitting, underfitting
    - Bias, variance
- Can we find appropriate solutions?

## Overfitting 
- Model performs very well on seen data
- Poor performance on unseen data
- Common problem

## Underfitting
- Poor performance on both seen and unseen data
