## The Process

<a name="SL_Process">![images/SL_Process.png](images/SL_Process.png)

- On the left hand side we have our data set D (This has been split)
- we have corresponding labels for data

The general procedure is as follows:
1. Start in the learning phase 
    - Training set data fed as an input to the model
    - This is compared to the ground truth 
    - Loss metric will indicate how well the model is performing
    - This will tell us how to update parameters theta
    - After some repetitions, perform validation using validation set
2. Testing
    - Model has fixed parameters
    - Evaluate how well the model performs
    - Decide if the model is sufficient or if we need to redesign and relearn
3. Prediction
    - New data the model has not seen before
    - Produce predictions from this new data
