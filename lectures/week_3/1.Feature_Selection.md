# Feature Selection

## Effects of Number of Features
- To fix high bias:
    - Increase input features
    - More information
    - Complexity increases
    - May result in high variance
- To fix high variance:
    - Decrease input features
    - Lower model complexity
    - May result in high bias
- Bias-Variance trade-off

Say we are trying to estimate a function with 3 features:
<br> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f_{\theta}=\theta_0+\theta_1x_1+\theta_2x_2\theta_3x_3"/> <br>
*i.e the ground truth has 3 pieces of information which produce this response*

Say we select a model of the following form:

<br> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_\theta(x)=\theta_0+\theta_1x_1"/> <br>
- There is no possible way for our model to represent the ground truth
- Too few features results in a high bias (offset between predicted value and true value)
- This is a low complex model, and may lead to low variance as there aren't many parameters to tune
- Low complexity model may lead to an overfitting of the training data for the same reasons


Adding complexity to the model may bring us a little closer to the ground truth
<br> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_\theta(x)=\theta_0+\theta_1x_1+\theta_2x_2"/> <br>
*However as we add more and more terms, the likelihood models that overfit or have high variance increases
- We may want to decrease model complexity i.e. eliminate input features that do no provide much information or are not useful to the task

## Variance Threshold

For each feature:
- Calculate variance
- High variance => useful information
Keep features with high variance:
- Use a threshold
This is straightforward and fast, but ignores relationships between features

## Recursive Feature Elimination
1. Train model
2. Eliminate feature with smallest coefficient 
3. Repeat 1-2 until you reach desired number of features

<br> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y=5x_1+6x_2+1x_3+2x_4"/> <br>
- This this case we would eliminate x3

Drawbacks to this methods:
- Training is expensive and takes time
- Coefficient are not always correlated 
- How many coefficients are desired? We might look at validation loss and find the smallest
